  active, the solar wind1,2 is observed at high latitudes as a predominantly fast (more than
  500?kilometres per second), highly Alfv{\'e}nic rarefied stream of plasma originating from deep
  within coronal holes. Closer to the ecliptic plane, the solar wind is interspersed with a more
  variable slow wind3 of less than 500 kilometres per second. The precise origins of the slow wind
  streams are less certain4; theories and observations suggest that they may originate at the tips
  of helmet streamers5,6, from interchange reconnection near coronal hole boundaries7,8, or within
  coronal holes with highly diverging magnetic fields9,10. The heating mechanism required to drive
  the solar wind is also unresolved, although candidate mechanisms include Alfv{\'e}n-wave
  turbulence11,12, heating by reconnection in nanoflares13, ion cyclotron wave heating14 and
  acceleration by thermal gradients1. At a distance of one astronomical unit, the wind is mixed and
  evolved, and therefore much of the diagnostic structure of these sources and processes has been
  lost. Here we present observations from the Parker Solar Probe15 at 36 to 54 solar radii that show
  evidence of slow Alfv{\'e}nic solar wind emerging from a small equatorial coronal hole. The
  measured magnetic field exhibits patches of large, intermittent reversals that are associated with
  jets of plasma and enhanced Poynting flux and that are interspersed in a smoother and less
  turbulent flow with a near-radial magnetic field. Furthermore, plasma-wave measurements suggest
  the existence of electron and ion velocity-space micro-instabilities10,16 that are associated with
  plasma heating and thermalization processes. Our measurements suggest that there is an impulsive
  mechanism associated with solar-wind energization and that micro-instabilities play a part in
  heating, and we provide evidence that low-latitude coronal holes are a key source of the slow
  solar wind.}, doi       = {10.1038/s41586-019-1818-7}, file      =

  precisely equivalent to the previously used three-dimensional electric field vector space. Unlike
  the electric field, the current density is restricted by the quasi-neutrality condition to a
  two-dimensional vector space. Comparison with previously obtained dispersion relations is provided
  and a method is presented for obtaining exact analytic solutions for the three roots of the cubic
  dispersion relation. The commonly used kinetic AlfvÃ©n dispersion relation is shown to be valid

  between AlfvÃ©n and fast modes vanishes and the AlfvÃ©n mode reverts to its cold form even in
  situations where the AlfvÃ©n velocity is smaller than the electron thermal velocity. A method is

  current sheets at 1 AU are analyzed in the 1998-2010 ACE solar-wind data set. The proton
  temperature, proton specific entropy, and electron temperature at each current sheet are compared
  with the same quantities in the plasmas adjacent to the current sheet. Statistically, the plasma
  at the current sheets is not hotter or of higher entropy than the plasmas just outside the current
  sheets. This is taken as evidence that there is no significant localized heating of the solar-wind
  protons or electrons at strong current sheets. Current sheets are, however, found to be more
  prevalent in hotter solar-wind plasma. This is because more current sheets are counted in the fast
  solar wind than in the slow solar wind, and the fast solar wind is hotter than the slow solar

  Abstract                 = {Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS), a NASA four-spacecraft constellation
  mission launched on March 12, 2015, will investigate magnetic reconnection in the boundary regions
  of the Earth's magnetosphere, particularly along its dayside boundary with the solar wind and the
  neutral sheet in the magnetic tail. The most important goal of MMS is to conduct a definitive
  experiment to determine what causes magnetic field lines to reconnect in a collisionless plasma.
  The significance of the MMS results will extend far beyond the Earth's magnetosphere because
  reconnection is known to occur in interplanetary space and in the solar corona where it is
  responsible for solar flares and the disconnection events known as coronal mass ejections. Active
  research is also being conducted on reconnection in the laboratory and specifically in
  magnetic-confinement fusion devices in which it is a limiting factor in achieving and maintaining
  electron temperatures high enough to initiate fusion. Finally, reconnection is proposed as the
  cause of numerous phenomena throughout the universe such as comet-tail disconnection events,
  magnetar flares, supernova ejections, and dynamics of neutron-star accretion disks. The MMS
  mission design is focused on answering specific questions about reconnection at the Earth's
  magnetosphere. The prime focus of the mission is on determining the kinetic processes occurring in

  etÂ al., we model the nonlinear terms in these equations using a simple phenomenology for the

  propagating away from the Sun than waves propagating toward the Sun. We then solve the equations
  analytically for waves with periods of hours and longer to obtain expressions for the wave
  amplitudes and turbulent heating rate as a function of heliocentric distance. We also develop a
  second approximate model that includes waves with periods of roughly one minute to one hour, which
  undergo less reflection than the longer-period waves, and compare our models to observations. Our
  models generalize the phenomenological model of Dmitruk etÂ al. by accounting for the solar wind
  velocity, so that the turbulent heating rate can be evaluated from the coronal base out past the
  AlfvÃ©n critical pointâthat is, throughout the region in which most of the heating and
  acceleration occurs. The simple analytical expressions that we obtain can be used to incorporate

  Abstract                 = {Protons in the solar corona and heliosphere exhibit anisotropic
  velocity distributions, violation of magnetic moment conservation, and a general lack of thermal
  equilibrium with the other particle species. There is no agreement about the identity of the
  physical processes that energize non-Maxwellian protons in the solar wind, but a traditional
  favorite has been the dissipation of ion cyclotron resonant AlfvÃ©n waves. This paper presents
  kinetic models of how ion cyclotron waves heat protons on their journey from the corona to
  interplanetary space. It also derives a wide range of new solutions for the relevant dispersion
  relations, marginal stability boundaries, and nonresonant velocity-space diffusion rates. A
  phenomenological model containing both cyclotron damping and turbulent cascade is constructed to
  explain the suppression of proton heating at low alpha-proton differential flow speeds. These
  effects are implemented in a large-scale model of proton thermal evolution from the corona to
  1Â AU. A Monte Carlo ensemble of realistic wind speeds, densities, magnetic field strengths, and
  heating rates produces a filled region of parameter space (in a plane described by the parallel
  plasma beta and the proton temperature anisotropy ratio) similar to what is measured. The
  high-beta edges of this filled region are governed by plasma instabilities and strong heating
  rates. The low-beta edges correspond to weaker proton heating and a range of relative
  contributions from cyclotron resonance. On balance, the models are consistent with other studies
  that find only a small fraction of the turbulent power spectrum needs to consist of ion cyclotron
  waves.}, Doi                      = {10.1088/0067-0049/213/1/16}, File                     =

  Abstract                 = {In the parts of the solar corona and solar wind that experience the
  fewest Coulomb collisions, the component proton, electron, and heavy ion populations are not in
  thermal equilibrium with one another. Observed differences in temperatures, outflow speeds, and
  velocity distribution anisotropies are useful constraints on proposed explanations for how the
  plasma is heated and accelerated. This paper presents new predictions of the rates of
  collisionless heating for each particle species, in which the energy input is assumed to come from
  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We first created an empirical description of the radial
  evolution of AlfvÃ©n, fast-mode, and slow-mode MHD waves. This model provides the total wave power
  in each mode as a function of distance along an expanding flux tube in the high-speed solar wind.
  Next, we solved a set of cascade advection-diffusion equations that give the time-steady
  wavenumber spectra at each distance. An approximate term for nonlinear coupling between the
  AlfvÃ©n and fast-mode fluctuations is included. For reasonable choices of the parameters, our
  model contains enough energy transfer from the fast mode to the AlfvÃ©n mode to excite the
  high-frequency ion cyclotron resonance. This resonance is efficient at heating protons and other
  ions in the direction perpendicular to the background magnetic field, and our model predicts
  heating rates for these species that agree well with both spectroscopic and in situ measurements.
  Nonetheless, the high-frequency waves comprise only a small part of the total AlfvÃ©nic
  fluctuation spectrum, which remains highly two dimensional as is observed in interplanetary
  space.}, Doi                      = {10.1088/0004-637x/754/2/92}, File                     =

  waves in the solar atmosphere and the fast solar wind. Linear non-WKB wave transport equations are
  solved from the photosphere to a distance past the orbit of the Earth, and for wave periods
  ranging from 3 s to 3 days. We derive a radially varying power spectrum of kinetic and magnetic
  energy fluctuations for waves propagating in both directions along a superradially expanding
  magnetic flux tube. This work differs from previous models in three major ways. (1) In the
  chromosphere and low corona, the successive merging of flux tubes on granular and supergranular
  scales is described using a two-dimensional magnetostatic model of a network element. Below a
  critical flux-tube merging height the waves are modeled as thin-tube kink modes, and we assume
  that all of the kink-mode wave energy is transformed into volume-filling AlfvÃ©n waves above the
  merging height. (2) The frequency power spectrum of horizontal motions is specified only at the
  photosphere, based on prior analyses of G-band bright point kinematics. Everywhere else in the
  model the amplitudes of outward and inward propagating waves are computed with no free parameters.
  We find that the wave amplitudes in the corona agree well with off-limb nonthermal line-width
  constraints. (3) Nonlinear turbulent damping is applied to the results of the linear model using a
  phenomenological energy loss term. A single choice for the normalization of the turbulent
  outer-scale length produces both the right amount of damping at large distances (to agree with in
  situ measurements) and the right amount of heating in the extended corona (to agree with
  empirically constrained solar wind acceleration models). In the corona, the modeled heating rate
  differs by more than an order of magnitude from a rate based on isotropic Kolmogorov turbulence.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a series of models for the plasma properties along open

  represent the first self-consistent solutions that combine (1) chromospheric heating driven by an
  empirically guided acoustic wave spectrum; (2) coronal heating from AlfvÃ©n waves that have been
  partially reflected, then damped by anisotropic turbulent cascade; and (3) solar wind acceleration
  from gradients of gas pressure, acoustic wave pressure, and AlfvÃ©n wave pressure. The only input
  parameters are the photospheric lower boundary conditions for the waves and the radial dependence
  of the background magnetic field along the flux tube. We have not included multifluid or
  collisionless effects (e.g., preferential ion heating), which are not yet fully understood. For a
  single choice for the photospheric wave properties, our models produce a realistic range of slow
  and fast solar wind conditions by varying only the coronal magnetic field. Specifically, a
  two-dimensional model of coronal holes and streamers at solar minimum reproduces the latitudinal
  bifurcation of slow and fast streams seen by Ulysses. The radial gradient of the AlfvÃ©n speed
  affects where the waves are reflected and damped, and thus whether energy is deposited below or
  above the Parker critical point. As predicted by earlier studies, a larger coronal "expansion
  factor" gives rise to a slower and denser wind, higher temperature at the coronal base, less
  intense AlfvÃ©n waves at 1 AU, and correlative trends for commonly measured ratios of ion charge
  states and FIP-sensitive abundances that are in general agreement with observations. These models
  offer supporting evidence for the idea that coronal heating and solar wind acceleration (in open
  magnetic flux tubes) can occur as a result of wave dissipation and turbulent cascade.}, Doi

  turbulent energy cascade to small length scales perpendicular to the mean magnetic field can be
  sustained by driving with low-frequency AlfvÃ©n waves reflected from mean density and magnetic
  field gradients. This mechanism deposits energy efficiently in the lower corona, and we show that
  the spatial distribution of the heating is determined by the mean density through the AlfvÃ©n
  speed profile. This provides a robust heating mechanism which can explain observed high coronal
  temperatures and accounts for the significant heating (per unit volume) distribution below 2 solar
  radii needed in models of the origin of the solar wind. The obtained heating per unit mass, on the
  other hand, is much more extended, indicating that the heating on a per-particle basis persists
  throughout all the lower coronal region considered here.}, Doi                      =

  and establishes the link between macroscopic and microscopic scales would open a new scenario in
  the study of turbulent heating in space plasmas. We present a numerical analysis of kinetic
  effects along the turbulent energy cascade in solar-wind plasmas which provides an effective
  unified interpretation of a wide set of spacecraft observations and shows that, simultaneously
  with an increase in the ion perpendicular temperature, strong bursts of electrostatic activity in
  the form of

  {Abstract Intervals of enhanced magnetic fluctuations have been frequently observed in the solar
  wind. But it remains an open question as to whether these waves are generated at the Sun and then
  transported outward by the solar wind or generated locally in the interplanetary medium. Magnetic
  field and plasma measurements from the Wind spacecraft under slow solar wind conditions on 19
  March 2005 demonstrate seven events of enhanced magnetic fluctuations at spacecraft-frame
  frequencies somewhat above the proton cyclotron frequency and propagation approximately parallel
  or antiparallel to the background magnetic field Bo. The proton velocity distributions during
  these events are characterized by two components: a more dense, slower core and a less dense,
  faster beam. Observed plasma parameters are used in a kinetic linear dispersion equation analysis
  for electromagnetic fluctuations at k x Boâ=â0; for two events the most unstable mode is the
  AlfvÃ©n-cyclotron instability driven by a proton component temperature anisotropy Tâ¥/T||â>â1
  (where the subscripts denote directions relative to Bo), and for three events the most unstable
  mode is the right-hand polarized magnetosonic instability driven primarily by ion component
  relative flows. Thus, both types of ion anisotropies and both types of instabilities are likely to
  be local sources of these enhanced fluctuation events in the solar wind.}, doi       =

  Abstract                 = {Spacecraft observations in the strongly compressed subsolar
  magnetosheath show an inverse correlation between the proton temperature anisotropy (Tâ¥p/Tâ¥p >
  Where â¥ and â¥ denote directions perpendicular and parallel to the background magnetic field)
  and the parallel proton Î² (Î²â¥p). This manuscript uses one-dimensional hybrid simulations of
  the proton cyclotron anisotropy instability in homogeneous electron-proton plasmas to study this
  correlation which may represent a limited closure relation for fluid theories of anisotropic space
  plasmas. The emphasis is on driven simulations which increase the temperature anisotropy by
  periodically reducing the magnetic-field-aligned velocities of the protons. The late-time states
  from ensembles of both initial value and driven simulations yield very similar expressions for the
  proton anisotropy/Î²â¥p inverse correlation, and provide a basis for explaining differences
  between sheath observations from different spacecraft. The driven simulations also yield
  expressions for the maximum instability growth rate and the fluctuating field energy as functions
  of Î²â¥p and a parameter characterizing the anisotropy driver.}, Doi                      =

  and associated kinetic instabilities on the growth of the tearing instability and particle
  heating. We confirm the ability of the ion cyclotron and firehose instabilities to enhance or
  suppress reconnection, respectively. The simulations demonstrate the emergence of persistent 3D
  structures, including patchy reconnection sites and the fast growth of a narrow-band drift-kink
  instability, which suppresses reconnection for thin current sheets with weak guide fields.
  Potential observational signatures of the 3D evolution of solar wind current sheets are also
  discussed. We conclude that kinetic instabilities, arising from non-Maxwellian ion populations,
  are significant to the evolution of 3D current sheets, and two-dimensional studies of heating
  rates by reconnection may therefore over-estimate the ability of thin, ion-scale current sheets to
  heat the solar wind by reconnection.}, Doi                      = {10.1088/0004-637x/802/1/4},

  Abstract                 = {The fluctuating magnetic helicity is considered an important parameter
  in diagnosing the characteristic modes of solar wind turbulence. Among them is the
  AlfvÃ©n-cyclotron wave, which is probably responsible for the solar wind plasma heating, but has
  not yet been identified from the magnetic helicity of solar wind turbulence. Here, we present the
  possible signatures of AlfvÃ©n-cyclotron waves in the distribution of magnetic helicity as a
  function of Î¸VB, which is the angle between the solar wind velocity and local mean magnetic
  field. We use magnetic field data from the STEREO spacecraft to calculate the Î¸VB distribution of
  the normalized reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity Ïm. We find a dominant negative Ïm for 1 s
  150Â° in the solar wind inward magnetic sector. These features of Ïm appearing around the
  Doppler-shifted ion-cyclotron frequencies may be consistent with the existence of
  AlfvÃ©n-cyclotron waves among the outward propagating fluctuations. Moreover, right-handed
  polarized waves at larger propagation angles, which might be kinetic AlfvÃ©n waves or whistler
  waves, have also been identified on the basis of the Ïm features in the angular range 40Â° < Î¸VB
  < 140Â°. Our findings suggest that AlfvÃ©n-cyclotron waves (together with other wave modes) play a
  prominent role in turbulence cascading and plasma heating of the solar wind.}, Doi

  Abstract                 = {Oblique fire hose instability is investigated using hybrid simulations
  for proton betas of the order of one and for proton parallel temperatures sufficiently greater
  than the perpendicular ones. The simulations confirm previous simulation results showing that this
  instability has self-destructing properties and efficiently reduces the proton temperature
  anisotropy. A parametric study using one-dimensional standard hybrid simulations shows that
  stronger changes in the temperature anisotropy and stronger wave emissions appear for larger
  initial temperature anisotropies. An ideal, slow plasma expansion, modeled by a two-dimensional
  hybrid expanding box simulation, leads to a generation of proton temperature anisotropy. The
  anisotropy leads first to destabilization of the dominant parallel fire hose, which interacts
  mainly with minor supra-AlfvÃ©nic protons, whereas the evolution of core protons is determined by
  expansion. Consequently, the effective anisotropy is only slightly reduced and the system
  eventually becomes unstable with respect to the oblique fire hose instability. The oblique fire
  hose strongly scatters the protons and removes the anisotropy disrupting the parallel fire hose.
  An important portion of the fluctuating wave energy is dissipated to protons, and only long
  wavelength waves remain in the system. The system with low wave activity then develops again
  larger temperature anisotropies, and the evolution repeats itself. It is concluded that both
  parallel and oblique proton fire hose instabilities constrain the proton temperature anisotropy in
  the expanding solar wind, with the latter one constituting a final frontier for the anisotropy.
  These results give a possible explanation of some apparent discrepancies between observations and
  linear predictions. In addition, a simple bounded anisotropy model is developed to include some of
  the kinetic effects of the fire hose instabilities in fluid models.}, Doi                      =

  Abstract                 = {We develop a series of new analytical expressions describing the
  physical properties of the kinetic AlfvÃ©n wave. The wave becomes strongly compressive when is of
  the order of the ion inertial length. Thus, in a low-Î² plasma, the kinetic AlfvÃ©n wave can be
  compressive at values of kâ¥ for which the dispersion relation departs only slightly from that of
  the usual MHD AlfvÃ©n wave. The compression is accompanied by a magnetic field fluctuation Î´Bâ
  such that the total pressure perturbation Î´ptot â 0. Thus the wave undergoes transit-time
  damping as well as Landau damping; the two effects are comparable if the ion thermal speed is of
  the order of the AlfvÃ©n speed. We find that the transverse electric field is elliptically
  polarized but rotating in the electron sense; this surprising behavior of the polarization of the
  AlfvÃ©n branch was discovered numerically by Gary [1986]. We derive a new dispersion relation
  which explicitly shows how the kinetic AlfvÃ©n wave takes on some properties of the large-kâ¥
  limit of the slow mode. We also derive approximate dispersion relations valid for a multi-ion
  plasma with differential streaming. We suggest that the kinetic AlfvÃ©n wave may be responsible
  for the flattening of density fluctuation spectra observed at large wavenumbers in the corona and
  in the solar wind. We also find that our derived properties of the kinetic AlfvÃ©n wave are
  consistent with its presence in the dissipation range of MHD turbulence [Leamon et al., 1998a,

  Abstract                 = {Previous wave-driven solar wind models (Hollweg, 1978) have been
  extended by including a new hypothesis for the nonlinear wave dissipation. The hypothesis is that
  the waves dissipate via a turbulent cascade at the rate given by (1) and the waves evolve
  according to (16). A subhypothesis is that the relevant correlation length scales as the distance
  between magnetic field lines. This hypothesis allows us to treat the corona and the solar wind on
  an equal footing; unlike in previous wave-driven models, we do not assume that the coronal heating
  takes place below the base of the model. The models exhibit the correct qualitative features,
  viz., a steep temperature rise (the transition region) to a maximum coronal temperature in excess
  of 106 K, and a substantial solar wind mass flux in excess of 3.5Ã108 cmâ2 sâ1 at 1 AU.
  However, the model fails in detail. Parameters that yield a high-speed flow at 1 AU have base
  pressures that are too low; parameters that yield correct base pressures have low solar wind flow
  speeds. However, the model âcomes close.â Thus although we have not shown that the initial
  hypothesis is consistent with available data, we feel that there are sufficient uncertainties both
  in the model and in the data to preclude outright rejection of the hypothesis altogether.}, Doi

  Abstract                 = {We analytically consider how velocity shear in the corona and solar
  wind can cause an initial AlfvÃ©n wave to drive up other propagating signals. The process is
  similar to the familiar coupling into other modes induced by non-WKB refraction in an
  inhomogeneous plasma, except here the refraction is a consequence of velocity shear. We limit our
  discussion to a low-beta plasma, and ignore couplings into signals resembling the slow mode. If
  the initial AlfvÃ©n wave is propagating nearly parallel to the background magnetic field, then the
  induced signals are mainly a forward-going (i.e., propagating in the same sense as the original
  AlfvÃ©n wave) fast mode, and a driven signal propagating like a forward-going AlfvÃ©n wave but
  polarized like the fast mode; both signals are compressive and subject to damping by the Landau
  resonance. For an initial AlfvÃ©n wave propagating obliquely with respect to the magnetic field,
  the induced signals are mainly forward- and backward-going fast modes, and a driven signal
  propagating like a forward-going AlfvÃ©n wave but polarized like the fast mode; these signals are
  all compressive and subject to damping by the Landau resonance. A backward-going AlfvÃ©n wave,
  thought to be important in the development of MHD turbulence, is also produced, but it is very
  weak. However, we suggest that for oblique propagation of the initial AlfvÃ©n wave the induced
  fast-polarized signal propagating like a forward-going AlfvÃ©n wave may interact coherently with
  the initial AlfvÃ©n wave and distort it at a strong-turbulence-like rate.}, Doi

  Abstract                 = {We extend the kinetic guiding-center model of collisionless coronal
  hole protons presented in Isenberg & Vasquez to consider driving by imbalanced spectra of
  obliquely propagating ion-cyclotron waves. These waves are assumed to be a small by-product of the
  imbalanced turbulent cascade to high perpendicular wavenumber, and their total intensity is taken
  to be 1% of the total fluctuation energy. We also extend the kinetic solutions for the proton
  distribution function in the resulting fast solar wind to heliocentric distances of 20 solar
  radii, which will be attainable by the Solar Probe Plus spacecraft. We consider three ratios of
  outward-propagating to inward-propagating resonant intensities: 1, 4, and 9. The self-consistent
  bulk flow speed reaches fast solar wind values in all cases, and these speeds are basically
  independent of the intensity ratio. The steady-state proton distribution is highly organized into
  nested constant-density shells by the resonant wave-particle interaction. The radial evolution of
  this kinetic distribution as the coronal hole plasma flows outward is understood as a competition
  between the inward- and outward-directed large-scale forces, causing an effective circulation of
  particles through the (vâ¥, vâ¥) phase space and a characteristic asymmetric shape to the
  distribution. These asymmetries are substantial and persist to the outer limit of the model
  computation, where they should be observable by the Solar Probe Plus instruments.}, Doi

  have observed strong narrow-band ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) in the solar wind near 1 AU. The waves
  propagate nearly parallel to the magnetic field and are below the local proton gyrofrequency in
  the solar wind frame. Because the twin STEREO spacecraft were far away from any planet, including
  the Earth, the waves do not have a planetary source. The ICWs often appear when the interplanetary
  magnetic field is more radial than the nominal Parker spiral. Since the wave frequency in the
  spacecraft frame is higher than the local proton gyrofrequency, the waves are not locally
  generated by ion pickup. Observations are consistent with wave generation closer to the Sun and
  outward transport by the super-AlfvÃ©nic solar wind. The waves are intrinsically left-hand
  polarized in the solar wind frame, but appear to be both left- and right-handed in the spacecraft
  frame, associated with outward and inward propagation, respectively. The relative amplitudes of
  the left-handed and right-handed waves support the closer-to-Sun generation scenario.}, Adsnote

  Abstract                 = {Transverse, near-circularly polarized, parallel-propagating
  electromagnetic waves around the proton cyclotron frequency were found sporadically in the solar
  wind throughout the inner heliosphere. They could play an important role in heating and
  accelerating the solar wind. These low-frequency waves (LFWs) are intermittent but often occur in
  prolonged bursts lasting over 10 minutes, named "LFW storms." Through a comprehensive survey of
  them from Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory A using dynamic spectral wave analysis, we have
  identified 241 LFW storms in 2008, present 0.9% of the time. They are left-hand (LH) or right-hand
  (RH) polarized in the spacecraft frame with similar characteristics, probably due to Doppler shift
  of the same type of waves or waves of intrinsically different polarities. In rare cases, the
  opposite polarities are observed closely in time or even simultaneously. Having ruled out
  interplanetary coronal mass ejections, shocks, energetic particles, comets, planets, and
  interstellar ions as LFW sources, we discuss the remaining generation scenarios: LH ion cyclotron
  instability driven by greater perpendicular temperature than parallel temperature or by ring-beam
  distribution, and RH ion fire hose instability driven by inverse temperature anisotropy or by cool
  ion beams. The investigation of solar wind conditions is compromised by the bias of the
  one-dimensional Maxwellian fit used for plasma data calibration. However, the LFW storms are
  preferentially detected in rarefaction regions following fast winds and when the magnetic field is
  radial. This preference may be related to the ion cyclotron anisotropy instability in fast wind
  and the minimum in damping along the radial field.}, Doi                      =

  Abstract                 = {The Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) Investigation on
  Solar Probe Plus is a four sensor instrument suite that provides complete measurements of the
  electrons and ionized helium and hydrogen that constitute the bulk of solar wind and coronal
  plasma. SWEAP consists of the Solar Probe Cup (SPC) and the Solar Probe Analyzers (SPAN). SPC is a
  Faraday Cup that looks directly at the Sun and measures ion and electron fluxes and flow angles as
  a function of energy. SPAN consists of an ion and electron electrostatic analyzer (ESA) on the ram
  side of SPP (SPAN-A) and an electron ESA on the anti-ram side (SPAN-B). The SPAN-A ion ESA has a
  time of flight section that enables it to sort particles by their mass/charge ratio, permitting
  differentiation of ion species. SPAN-A and -B are rotated relative to one another so their broad
  fields of view combine like the seams on a baseball to view the entire sky except for the region
  obscured by the heat shield and covered by SPC. Observations by SPC and SPAN produce the combined
  field of view and measurement capabilities required to fulfill the science objectives of SWEAP and
  Solar Probe Plus. SWEAP measurements, in concert with magnetic and electric fields, energetic
  particles, and white light contextual imaging will enable discovery and understanding of solar
  wind acceleration and formation, coronal and solar wind heating, and particle acceleration in the
  inner heliosphere of the solar system. SPC and SPAN are managed by the SWEAP Electronics Module
  (SWEM), which distributes power, formats onboard data products, and serves as a single electrical
  interface to the spacecraft. SWEAP data products include ion and electron velocity distribution
  functions with high energy and angular resolution. Full resolution data are stored within the
  SWEM, enabling high resolution observations of structures such as shocks, reconnection events, and
  other transient structures to be selected for download after the fact. This paper describes the
  implementation of the SWEAP Investigation, the driving requirements for the suite, expected
  performance of the instruments, and planned data products, as of mission preliminary design

  Abstract                 = {The prediction of a supersonic solar wind1 was first confirmed by
  spacecraft near Earth2,3 and later by spacecraft at heliocentric distances as small as 62 solar
  radii4. These missions showed that plasma accelerates as it emerges from the corona, aided by
  unidentified processes that transport energy outwards from the Sun before depositing it in the
  wind. Alfv{\'e}nic fluctuations are a promising candidate for such a process because they are seen
  in the corona and solar wind and contain considerable energy5-7. Magnetic tension forces the
  corona to co-rotate with the Sun, but any residual rotation far from the Sun reported until now
  has been much smaller than the amplitude of waves and deflections from interacting wind streams8.
  Here we report observations of solar-wind plasma at heliocentric distances of about 35 solar
  radii9-11, well within the distance at which stream interactions become important. We find that
  Alfv{\'e}n waves organize into structured velocity spikes with duration of up to minutes, which
  are associated with propagating S-like bends in the magnetic-field lines. We detect an increasing
  rotational component to the?flow velocity of the solar wind around the Sun, peaking at 35 to 50
  kilometres per second--considerably above the amplitude of the waves. These flows exceed classical
  velocity predictions of a few kilometres per second, challenging models of circulation in the
  corona and calling into question our understanding of how stars lose angular momentum and spin
  down as they age12-14.}, Doi                      = {10.1038/s41586-019-1813-z}, File

  Abstract                 = {The changing relationships between solar wind speed, helium abundance,
  and minor ion charge state are examined over solar cycle 23. Observations of the abundance of
  helium relative to hydrogen (A He â¡ 100 Ã n He/n H) by the Wind spacecraft are used to examine
  the dependence of A He on solar wind speed and solar activity between 1994 and 2010. This work
  updates an earlier study of A He from 1994 to 2004 to include the recent extreme solar minimum and
  broadly confirms our previous result that A He in slow wind is strongly correlated with sunspot
  number, reaching its lowest values in each solar minima. During the last minimum, as sunspot
  numbers reached their lowest levels in recent history, A He continued to decrease, falling to half
  the levels observed in slow wind during the previous minimum and, for the first time observed,
  decreasing even in the fastest solar wind. We have also extended our previous analysis by adding
  measurements of the mean carbon and oxygen charge states observed with the Advanced Composition
  Explorer spacecraft since 1998. We find that as solar activity decreased, the mean charge states
  of oxygen and carbon for solar wind of a given speed also fell, implying that the wind was formed
  in cooler regions in the corona during the recent solar minimum. The physical processes in the
  coronal responsible for establishing the mean charge state and speed of the solar wind have
  evolved with solar activity and time.}, Doi                      = {10.1088/0004-637x/745/2/162},

  perpendicular signatures in magnetic helicity measurements segregated by wave period and angle
  between the local magnetic field and the solar wind velocity, this paper undertakes a comparison
  of three intervals of Ulysses data with synthetic time series generated from a physically
  motivated turbulence model. From these comparisons, it is hypothesized that the observed
  signatures result from a perpendicular cascade of AlfvÃ©nic fluctuations and a local,
  non-turbulent population of ion-cyclotron or whistler waves generated by temperature anisotropy
  instabilities. By constraining the model's free parameters through comparison to in situ data, it
  is found that, on average, â¼95% of the power near dissipative scales is contained in a
  perpendicular AlfvÃ©nic cascade and that the parallel fluctuations are propagating nearly
  unidirectionally. The effects of aliasing on magnetic helicity measurements are considered and
  shown to be significant near the Nyquist frequency.}, Doi                      =

  photospheric motions provide the energy source and that the magnetic field must play a key role in
  the process. Verdini et al. presented a model for heating and accelerating the solar wind based on
  the turbulent dissipation of AlfvÃ©n waves. We first use a time-dependent model of the solar wind
  to reproduce one of Verdini et al.'s solutions; then, we extend its application to the case where
  the energy equation includes thermal conduction and radiation losses, and the upper chromosphere
  is part of the computational domain. Using this model, we explore the parameter space and describe
  the characteristics of a fast solar wind solution. We discuss how this formulation may be applied
  to a three-dimensional MHD model of the corona and solar wind.}, Doi                      =

  Abstract                 = {Kinetic microinstabilities in the solar wind arise when its
  non-thermal properties become too extreme. This thesis project focused specifically on the four
  instabilities associated with ion temperature anisotropy: the cyclotron, mirror, and parallel and
  oblique firehose instabilities. Numerous studies have provided evidence that proton temperature
  anisotropy in the solar wind is limited by the actions of these instabilities. For this project, a
  fully revised analysis of data from the \it{Wind} spacecraftÃ¢ÂÂs Faraday cups and calculations
  from linear Vlasov theory were used to extend these findings in two respects. First, theoretical
  thresholds were derived for $\alpha$-particle temperature anisotropy instabilities, which were
  then found to be consistent with a statistical analysis of Wind $\alpha$-particle data. This
  suggests that $\alpha$-particles, which constitute only about $5\%$ of ions in the solar wind, are
  nevertheless able to drive temperature anisotropy instabilities. Second, a statistical analysis of
  Wind proton data found that proton temperature was significantly enhanced in plasma unstable due
  to proton temperature anisotropy. This implies that extreme proton temperature anisotropies in
  solar wind at $1$ AU arise from ongoing anisotropic heating (versus cooling from, e.g., CGL double
  adiabatic expansion). Together, these results provide further insight into the complex evolution
  of the solar windÃ¢ÂÂs non-fluid properties.}, Comment                  = {Also available (for a

  Abstract                 = {NASA's Parker Solar Probe mission1 recently plunged through the inner
  heliosphere of the Sun to its perihelia, about 24 million kilometres from the Sun. Previous
  studies farther from the Sun (performed mostly at a distance of 1 astronomical unit) indicate that
  solar energetic particles are accelerated from a few kiloelectronvolts up to near-relativistic
  energies via at least two processes: 'impulsive' events, which are usually associated with
  magnetic reconnection in solar flares and are typically enriched in electrons, helium-3 and
  heavier ions2, and 'gradual' events3,4, which are typically associated with large
  coronal-mass-ejection-driven shocks and compressions moving through the corona and inner solar
  wind?and are?the?dominant?source of protons with energies between?1 and 10 megaelectronvolts.
  However, some events show aspects of both processes and the electron-proton ratio is not bimodally
  distributed, as would be expected if there were only two possible processes5. These processes have
  been very difficult to resolve from prior observations, owing to the various transport effects
  that affect the energetic particle population en route to more distant spacecraft6. Here we report
  observations of the near-Sun energetic particle radiation environment over the first two orbits of
  the probe. We find a variety of energetic particle events accelerated both locally and remotely
  including by corotating interaction regions, impulsive events driven by acceleration near the Sun,
  and an event related to a coronal mass ejection. We provide direct observations of the energetic
  particle radiation environment in the region just above the corona of the Sun and directly explore
  the physics of particle acceleration and transport.}, Doi                      =

  Abstract                 = {In situ studies of the magnetic fields in space by spacecraft (S/C)
  began 4 decades ago. The experiments were initially difficult to perform and interpret accurately
  because of contamination by S/C-generated magnetic fields, partial measurements of the vector
  field, limited mass and power for the instrumentation, low-data-rate sampling, discontinuous or
  spotty data coverage, and sometimes unknown orientation or location of the S/C. As each of these
  challenges was overcome, an initial view of the macrostructure of the interplanetary magnetic
  field (IMF) emerged, substantiating the Archimedean spiral structure and solar origin of the IMF
  as proposed theoretically by E. N. Parker. An important mesoscale feature noted early on was the
  sectoring of the IMF into an ordered sequence of alternating polarities associated with solar
  sources. Subsequent studies catalogued the microscale magnetohydrodynamic structures: shock waves,
  and tangential and rotational discontinuities and fluctuations. Correlations with solar
  photospheric magnetic fields, coronal holes and in situ plasma, and energetic particles elaborated
  more completely on the structure and dynamics of the IMF. This paper will provide a brief
  historical summary of the study of the IMF or, as it is now more commonly referred to, the
  heliospheric magnetic field (HMF).}, Doi                      = {10.1029/2000JA000118}, Eprint

  large components of the magnetic field normal to the discontinuity surface that are commonly
  assumed to be signatures of rotational discontinuities (RDs). Those results call into question the
  validity of earlier studies based on the minimum variance technique for determining the direction
  of the normal to the discontinuity; many of those studies concluded that RDs occur more frequently
  than tangential discontinuities (TDs). The new results raise the question of whether the
  discontinuities with both small magnitude changes and small normal components are TDs with small
  magnitude changes or RDs with small normal components. Reexamination of an earlier study of
  discontinuities observed with the ISEE 3 spacecraft and consideration of the plasma jump
  conditions across some of the discontinuities observed by Cluster fail to give a clear answer. The
  pros and cons of the two interpretations are summarized.}, Doi                      =

  magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) turbulence between the Sun and the AlfvÃ©n critical point. These are
  the first such simulations that take into account the solar-wind outflow velocity and the radial
  inhomogeneity of the background solar wind without approximating the nonlinear terms in the
  governing equations. RMHD turbulence is driven by outward-propagating AlfvÃ©n waves (z +
  fluctuations) launched from the Sun, which undergo partial non-WKB reflection to produce
  sunward-propagating AlfvÃ©n waves (z â fluctuations). We present 10 simulations with different
  values of the correlation time and perpendicular correlation length L â¥â of
  outward-propagating AlfvÃ©n waves at the coronal base. We find that between 15% and 33% of the z +
  energy launched into the corona dissipates between the coronal base and AlfvÃ©n critical point.
  Between 33% and 40% of this input energy goes into work on the solar-wind outflow, and between 22%
  and 36% escapes as z + fluctuations through the simulation boundary at r = r A. The z Â± power
  spectra scale like , where k â¥ is the wavenumber in the plane perpendicular to B 0. In our
  simulation with the smallest value of (â¼2 minutes) and largest value of L â¥â (2 Ã 104 km),
  we find that Î±+ decreases approximately linearly with increasing ln (r), reaching a value of 1.3
  at r = 11.1 R â. Our simulations with larger values of exhibit alignment between the contours of
  constant Ï+, Ïâ, , and , where ÏÂ± are the ElsÃ¤sser potentials and are the outer-scale

  Abstract                 = {The solar wind proton temperature at 1 au has been found to be
  correlated with small-scale intermittent magnetic structures, i.e., regions with enhanced
  temperature are associated with coherent structures, such as current sheets. Using Parker Solar
  Probe data from the first encounter, we study this association using measurements of the radial
  proton temperature, employing the partial variance of increments (PVI) technique to identify
  intermittent magnetic structures. We observe that the probability density functions of high PVI
  events have higher median temperatures than those with lower PVI. The regions in space where PVI
  peaks were also locations that had enhanced temperatures when compared with similar regions,
  suggesting a heating mechanism in the young solar wind that is associated with intermittency
  developed by a nonlinear turbulent cascade in the immediate vicinity.}, Doi                      =

  planarity of polarization, and electromagnetic planarity. Simulations of Z-mode waves, which
  simultaneously propagate with different wave vectors, indicate that the SVD methods give
  reasonable results even if the assumption on the presence of a single plane wave is invalid.
  Simulations of whistler mode waves show that these methods can be used to recognize cases when the
  waves simultaneously propagate with wave vectors in two opposite hemispheres. Finally, we show an
  example of analysis of natural whistler mode and Z-mode emissions measured in the high-altitude
  auroral region by the MEMO experiment onboard the INTERBALL spacecraft.}, Doi

  analysis of Probability Distribution Functions (PDF) for velocity fluctuations, which display a
  strong non-gaussian behavior at small scales. Castaing et al. (1990) have introduced the idea that
  this behavior can be represented, in the framework of a multiplicative cascade model, by a
  convolution of gaussians whose variances is distributed according to a log-normal distribution. In
  this letter we have tried to test this conjecture on the MHD solar wind turbulence by performing a
  fit of the PDF of the bulk speed and magnetic field intensity fluctuations calculated in the solar
  wind, with the model. This fit allows us to calculate a parameter Î»Â² depending on the scale,
  which represents the width of the log-normal distribution of the variances of the gaussians. The
  physical implications of the obtained values of the parameter as well as of its scaling law are
  finally discussed.}, Doi                      = {10.1029/1999GL900270}, Eprint                   =

  collisionless damping via resonant wave-particle interactions versus dissipation in small-scale
  current sheets in weakly collisional plasma turbulence. Current sheets form self-consistently from
  the wave-driven turbulence, and their filling fraction is well correlated to the electron heating
  rate. However, the weakly collisional nature of the simulation necessarily implies that the
  current sheets are not significantly dissipated via Ohmic dissipation. Rather, collisionless
  damping via the Landau resonance with the electrons is sufficient to account for the measured
  heating as a function of scale in the simulation, without the need for significant Ohmic
  dissipation. This finding suggests the possibility that the dissipation of the current sheets is
  governed by resonant wave-particle interactions and that the locations of current sheets
  correspond spatially to regions of enhanced heating.}, Doi                      =

  associations between features of interplanetary suprathermal energetic particle (EP) data and
  rapid changes in the interplanetary vector magnetic field. The latter are connected to
  intermittency and coherent magnetic structures, including classical discontinuities. Here we
  discuss these observations in the context of two appealing theoretical ideas: First, magnetic
  structures bounding flux tubes can cause local or temporary topological trapping, thus influencing
  EP transport. Second, charged particles may be accelerated by interacting with dynamic flux tubes,
  either through reconnection, trapping in secondary islands, or a betatron mechanism. We present
  observations that support interpretation in terms of trapping boundaries associated with changes
  in EP flux and also find a case in which an EP peak lies near a coherent magnetic structure that
  is not a shock, with changing particle anisotropy consistent with outflow from the structure,
  suggestive of local particle acceleration.}, Doi                      = {10.1002/2016GL068045},

  Abstract                 = {Interplanetary discontinuities have been investigated at heliocentric
  distances between 1 and 8.5 AU by using Pioneer 10 and 11 vector helium magnetometer observations.
  The principal purpose of the study was to investigate a possible dependence of the rate of
  occurrence and properties of the discontinuities on radial distance. This objective required a
  separation of spatial and temporal variations and used the simultaneous nearly continuous data
  from both spacecraft. Discontinuities were identified by using carefully developed criteria that
  were shown to be comparable to those used in earlier studies but which are still applicable in the
  weak magnetic fields that are typical of large radial distances. Special attention was given to
  the identification of relatively thick discontinuities in the expectation that discontinuities
  might grow progressively thicker with distance. The statistics associated with the rate of
  occurrence of discontinuities have been shown to be well approximated by a Poisson distribution.
  The rate of occurrence of discontinuities undergoes large variations, from day to day and from one
  solar rotation to another, which are well outside the deviations to be expected on the basis of
  statistical fluctuations alone. Temporal changes in the rate of occurrence averaged over Bartels
  solar rotations were well correlated at Pioneer 10 and 11, which were separated by a distance of
  â2 AU. The time variations consisted of a slow modulation of the rate of occurrence such that
  successive increases and decreases persisted for several months at a time, presumably as a result
  of changing solar conditions. The correlation over widely separated distances is most simply
  interpreted by a model in which the discontinuities originate inside 1 AU, probably near the sun,
  and are convected outward by the solar wind. Further support for this model is provided by the
  statistical properties of the discontinuities at 1 and 5 AU, which were found to be very similar.
  Clear evidence of a decrease in the rate of occurrence Ï with distance has been obtained. The
  simultaneous rates from the two spacecraft reveal that this decrease is well approximated on the
  average by the function Ï=50eâ(Râ1)/4 and imply a radial gradient of 25\% per astronomical
  unit. This gradient may be apparent and does not necessarily imply that discontinuities actually
  occur less frequently at large radial distances. The decreased rate of occurrence may be
  associated with an increasing thickness of the discontinuities such that they no longer satisfy
  the identification criteria. Possible evidence of a dependence of Ï on heliographic latitude was
  sought, but no statistically significant dependence was found. The results of this study are
  inconsistent with previous inferences of a very large radial or latitudinal gradient on the basis
  of Pioneer 8 data (Mariani et al., 1973). The reason for this earlier result was probably the
  influence of time variations which occurred on a scale of several months, as was found in our
  study, and masqueraded as spatial variations.}, Doi                      =

  waves, with phase velocity close to the ion thermal speed, has been recovered in the simulations.
  In this Letter, we show that these waves turn out to be Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal-like solutions of
  the hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell equations, driven by kinetic effects of resonant particle trapping. We
  also discuss the development of the solar-wind turbulent spectra across the ion inertial length

  data analysis on the other hand have allowed for much progress in our understanding of
  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. In particular the high resolution of solar wind measurements
  has allowed us to characterize the intermittency observed on small scales.  In this paper we will
  give a schematic view of the main properties of solar wind MHD turbulence and discuss some recent
  results obtained from the analysis of velocity and magnetic field data measured during the space
  experiments Helios and ISEE. In particular, we will show that applying Haar wavelets technique to
  about one year of data taken every minute during the ISEE space experiment, it is possible to
  calculate spectra and structure functions of the turbulence; moreover the definition of
  conditioned structure function allows: (a) for the elimination of intermittency effects in spectra
  and thus for a clear identification of which kind of phenomenology of nonlinear cascade between
  Kolmogorov and Kraichnan is taking place in the solar wind turbulence; (b) for the identification
  of the most intermittent structures which turn out to be either shock waves or one-dimensional
  current sheets, at variance with ordinary fluid intermittency, where the most intermittent
  structures are found to be two-dimensional vortices.}, Doi                      =

  that the turbulent spectra are influenced by the nature of the reflected waves. Close to the base,
  these give rise to a flatter and steeper spectrum for the outgoing and reflected waves,
  respectively. At higher heliocentric distance both spectra evolve toward an asymptotic Kolmogorov
  spectrum. The turbulent dissipation is found to account for at least half of the heating required
  to sustain the background imposed solar wind and its shape is found to be determined by the
  reflection-determined turbulent heating below 1.5 solar radii. Therefore, reflection and

  driving the average value of Rp away from the marginal stability boundary until the fluctuating
  value of Rp stops crossing the boundary. We model this ``fluctuating-anisotropy effect'' using
  linear Vlasov-Maxwell theory to describe the large-scale compressive fluctuations. We show that
  this effect can explain why, in the nearly collisionless solar wind, the average value of Rp is
  close to unity.}, Adsnote                  = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System},

  include dissipative processes that terminate the cascade. Here kinetic plasma simulations and

  signatures of various dissipation mechanisms. Kurtosis of increments indicates that kinetic scale
  coherent structures are present, with some suggestion of incoherent activity near ion scales.
  Conditioned proton temperature distributions suggest heating associated with coherent structures.
  The results reinforce the association of intermittent turbulence, coherent structures, and plasma

  {Weakly collisional space plasmas are rarely in local thermal equilibrium and often exhibit
  non-Maxwellian electron and ion velocity distributions that lead to the growth of
  microinstabilities?that is, enhanced electric and magnetic fields at relatively short wavelengths.
  These instabilities play an active role in the evolution of space plasmas, as does ubiquitous
  broadband turbulence induced by turbulent structures. This study compares certain properties of a
  2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation for the forward cascade of Alfvénic turbulence
  in a collisionless plasma against the same properties of turbulence observed by the Magnetospheric
  Multiscale Mission spacecraft in the terrestrial magnetosheath. The PIC simulation is of decaying
  turbulence that develops both coherent structures and anisotropic ion velocity distributions with
  the potential to drive kinetic scale instabilities. The uniform background magnetic field points
  perpendicular to the plane of the simulation. Growth rates are computed from linear theory using
  the ion temperature anisotropies and ion beta values for both the simulation and the observations.
  Both the simulation and the observations show that strong anisotropies and growth rates occur
  highly intermittently in the plasma, and the simulation further shows that such anisotropies
  preferentially occur near current sheets. This suggests that, though microinstabilities may affect
  the plasma globally, they act locally and develop in response to extreme temperature anisotropies
  generated by turbulent structures. Further studies will be necessary to understand why there is an
  apparent correlation between linear instability theory and strongly intermittent turbulence.}, doi

  abstract   = {The last decade has witnessed a tremendous growths of interests in applications that
  deal with querying and mining of time series data. Numerous representation methods for
  dimensionality reduction and similarity measures geared towards time series have been introduced.
  Each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and, aside from the
  occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative experimental observations. However,
  for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on
  demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In
  order to provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive set of time series
  experiments re-implementing 8 different representation methods and 9 similarity measures and their
  variants, and testing their effectiveness on 38 time series data sets from a wide variety of
  application domains. In this paper, we give an overview of these different techniques and present
  our comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. Our experiments have provided
  both a unified validation of some of the existing achievements, and in some cases, suggested that
  certain claims in the literature may be unduly optimistic.}, doi        =

  highly Alfvénic activity, where velocity fluctuations and magnetic fluctuations are aligned or
  antialigned with each other. It is generally agreed that solar wind plasma velocity and magnetic
  field fluctuations observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during the first encounter are mostly
  highly Alfvénic. However, quantitative measures of Alfvénicity are needed to understand how the
  characterization of these fluctuations compares with standard measures from prior missions in the
  inner and outer heliosphere, in fast wind and slow wind, and at high and low latitudes. To
  investigate this issue, we employ several measures to quantify the extent of Alfvénicity—the
  Alfvén ratio r
A, the normalized cross helicity σ

c, the normalized residual energy σ

r, and the cosine of angle between velocity and magnetic fluctuations . We show that despite the
overall impression that the Alfvénicity is large in the solar wind sampled by PSP during the first
encounter, during some intervals the cross helicity starts decreasing at very large scales. These
length scales (often >1000d

i) are well inside inertial range, and therefore, the suppression of cross helicity at these scales
cannot be attributed to kinetic physics. This drop at large scales could potentially be explained by
large scale shears present in the inner heliosphere sampled by PSP. In some cases, despite the cross
helicity being constant down to the noise floor, the residual energy decreases with scale in the
inertial range. These results suggest that it is important to consider all these measures to
quantify Alfvénicity.},

  order to compose data sequence with highly similar meteorological features. With this method, we
  reduced SVM training data and overcame the disadvantage of very large data and slow processing
  speed when constructing SVM model. This paper proposes a new feature selection mechanism based on
  ant colony optimization in an attempt to combat the aforemention difficulties. The method is then
  applied to find optimal feature subsets in the fuzzy-rough data reduction process. The present
  work is applied to complex systems monitoring, the ant colony optimization can mine the data more
  overall and accurate than the original fuzzy-rough method, an entropy-based feature selector, and
  a transformation-based reduction method, PCA. Comparing with single SVM and BP neural network in

  waves have been invoked in association with auroral currents and particle acceleration since the
  pioneering work of Hasegawa [1976]. However, to date, no work has considered the dispersion
  relation including the full kinetic effects for both electrons and ions. Results from such a
  calculation are presented, with emphasis on the role of Landau damping in dissipating Alfvén waves
  which propagate from the warm plasma of the outer magnetosphere to the cold plasma present in the
  ionosphere. It is found that the Landau damping is not important when the perpendicular wavelength
  is larger than the ion acoustic gyroradius and the electron inertial length. In addition, ion
  gyroradius effects lead to a reduction in the Landau damping by raising the parallel phase
  velocity of the wave above the electron thermal speed in the short perpendicular wavelength
  regime. These results indicate that low-frequency Alfvén waves with perpendicular wavelengths
  greater than the order of 10 km when mapped to the ionosphere will not be significantly affected
  by Landau damping. While these results, based on the local dispersion relation, are strictly valid
  only for short parallel wavelength Alfvén waves, they do give an indication of the importance of
  Landau damping for longer parallel wavelength waves such as field line resonances.}, doi      =

  compromises, but this is new neither in science nor exploration. Such a step would be an

  advocated a scientific probe to the interstellar medium for over 30 years. While the Voyager
  spacecraft have passed through the termination shock of the solar wind, they have limited
  lifetimes as their radioisotope power supplies decay. It remains unclear whether they can reach
  the heliopause, the boundary between shocked solar wind and interstellar plasmas, and, in any
  case, they will not reach the undisturbed interstellar medium. As with most exploratory space
  missions, their ongoing observations continue to raise even more questions about the nature of the
  interaction of our heliosphere and the interstellar medium. Scientific questions including:1.What
  is the nature of the nearby interstellar medium?2.How do the Sun and galaxy affect the dynamics of
  the heliosphere?3.What is the structure of the heliosphere?4.How did matter in the solar system
  and interstellar medium originate and evolve?can only be answered by an “interstellar precursor”
  probe. Such a mission is required to make in situ measurements in the interaction region and
  interstellar medium itself at distances far from the Sun, but in a finite mission lifetime. By
  launching a probe toward the incoming “interstellar wind,” whose direction is known, the distance
  to be traveled can be minimized but is still large. The current consensus is that a scientifically
  compelling mission must function to at least a distance of 200 astronomical units (AU) from the
  Sun and return a reasonable stream of data during the voyage. The central problem is that of
  providing a means of propulsion to accelerate a probe from the Solar System. Even with a low-mass
  payload and spacecraft, achieving the high speeds needed, even with gravity assists, have remained
  problematic. Voyager 1, the fastest object ever to leave the system is now traveling ∼3.6AU/yr,
  and a credible probe must reach at least 2–3 times this speed. The use of an Ares V is an approach
  for enabling a fast interstellar precursor mission. Maximum capability uses the combination of an
  Ares V, two-engine Centaur upper stage, close fly-by of Jupiter, and radioisotope electric
  propulsion (REP). Deletion of any of these pieces does not disable the mission, but does increase
  the flyout time to a given distance. This approach is more robust and provides a faster probe than
  an earlier alternative, designed for launch by a Delta IV 4050H plus twin Star 48A upper stages.},

  significant new puzzles for describing the interaction physics. Direct measurements of the
  shocked, solar-wind flow speed are now possible (from Voyager 2) and show the flow remains
  supersonic. This is one more piece of evidence supporting the idea that the bulk of the energy
  density in the plasma resides in a non-thermal component that extends to very high energies. There
  are both quantitative and qualitative implications for the overall heliospheric structure.
  Observations of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) by IBEX (in Earth orbit) from the interaction
  region(s) of the solar wind and the VLISM show unexpected structure on a variety of scales. In
  addition to the general “glow” of the sky in ENAs, IBEX data show a relatively narrow “ribbon” of
  atomic hydrogen emission from ∼200 to ∼6keV, roughly circular, but asymmetric in intensity, and
  centered on an ecliptic longitude ∼221 degrees and ecliptic latitude of 39 degrees. The ribbon may
  be ordered by the interstellar magnetic field. It passes through, rather than being centered on,
  the “nose” from which the local, neutral interstellar wind enters the Heliosphere, indicating that
  the flow is not the primary driver of the system as had been thought previously. The neutrals from
  both the glow and ribbon are also characterized by non-thermal distribution functions. ENAs are
  observed at higher energies as well by the Ion and Neutral Camera (INCA) on Cassini (in orbit
  about Saturn). A “belt” of emission, broader than the ribbon but similar to it, is seen up to
  ∼50keV. These observations emphasize the need for in situ measurements to understand the global
  nature of our local galactic environment, which is much more complex than previously thought. Only
  an interstellar probe with modern instruments and measurement requirements better defined by these
  recent observations can provide the new information required. Even more importantly, the broader
  scale of the interaction as revealed in these measurements suggests much greater flexibility in
  scientifically allowable, asymptotic trajectories from the heliosphere for the probe. This is a
  significant relaxation in the trajectory requirements that open up the trade space for Jupiter
  gravity assists to increase the flyout speeds.}, dateadded = {2021-01-25}, doi       =

  an old approach in which a small probe obtains significant solar-system escape speeds by
  “dropping” deep into the Sun's gravitational potential well and then executing a ΔV maneuver at
  perihelion. This implementation requires a very robust and autonomous, yet low-mass spacecraft, as
  well as an advanced perihelion propulsion system that can be used while the probe is thermally
  protected from the near-Sun environment. Many of the engineering problems are driven by the need
  for reliable decades-long cruise in deep space and so are largely independent of the propulsion
  system. Such a long-lived probe could be queried at random over decades of otherwise hands-off

This quadratic model matches the measured values of the magnetic field and its curl (current) at each spacecraft, with ∇ • B zero everywhere, and thus extends the linear curlometer method to second order. Near the spacecraft, it predicts the topology of magnetic structures, such as reconnecting regions or flux ropes, and allows a tracking of the motion of these structures relative to the spacecraft constellation. Comparisons to particle-in-cell simulations estimate the model accuracy. Reconstruction of two electron diffusion regions definitively confirms the expected field line structure. The model can be applied to other small-scale phenomena (e.g., bow shocks) and can also be modified to reconstruct the electric field, allowing tracing of particle trajectories.},

  abstract  = {AbstractIn this study, we apply a new method—the first-order Taylor expansion (FOTE)—to find magnetic nulls and reconstruct magnetic field topology, in order to use it with the data from the forthcoming MMS mission. We compare this method with the previously used Poincare index (PI), and find that they are generally consistent, except that the PI method can only find a null inside the spacecraft (SC) tetrahedron, while the FOTE method can find a null both inside and outside the tetrahedron and also deduce its drift velocity. In addition, the FOTE method can (1) avoid limitations of the PI method such as data resolution, instrument uncertainty (Bz offset), and SC separation; (2) identify 3-D null types (A, B, As, and Bs) and determine whether these types can degenerate into 2-D (X and O); (3) reconstruct the magnetic field topology. We quantitatively test the accuracy of FOTE in positioning magnetic nulls and reconstructing field topology by using the data from 3-D kinetic simulations. The influences of SC separation (0.05~1 di) and null-SC distance (0~1 di) on the accuracy are both considered. We find that (1) for an isolated null, the method is accurate when the SC separation is smaller than 1 di, and the null-SC distance is smaller than 0.25~0.5 di; (2) for a null pair, the accuracy is same as in the isolated-null situation, except at the separator line, where the field is nonlinear. We define a parameter ξ ≡ |( λ1 + λ2 + λ3 )|/|λ|max in terms of the eigenvalues (λi) of the null to quantify the quality of our method—the smaller this parameter the better the results. Comparing to the previously used parameter (η≡|∇ ⋅ B|/|∇ × B|), ξ is more relevant for null identification. Using the new method, we reconstruct the magnetic field topology around a radial-type null and a spiral-type null, and find that the topologies are well consistent with those predicted in theory. We therefore suggest using this method to find magnetic nulls and reconstruct field topology with four-point measurements, particularly from Cluster and the forthcoming MMS mission. For the MMS mission, this null-finding algorithm can be used to trigger its burst-mode measurements.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The Wind spacecraft, launched on November 1, 1994, is a critical element in NASA’s Heliophysics System Observatory (HSO)—a fleet of spacecraft created to understand the dynamics of the Sun-Earth system. The combination of its longevity (>25 years in service), its diverse complement of instrumentation, and high resolution and accurate measurements has led to it becoming the “standard candle” of solar wind measurements. Wind has over 55 selectable public data products with over ∼1,100 total data variables (including OMNI data products) on SPDF/CDAWeb alone. These data have led to paradigm shifting results in studies of statistical solar wind trends, magnetic reconnection, large-scale solar wind structures, kinetic physics, electromagnetic turbulence, the Van Allen radiation belts, coronal mass ejection topology, interplanetary and interstellar dust, the lunar wake, solar radio bursts, solar energetic particles, and extreme astrophysical phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts. This review introduces the mission and instrument suites then discusses examples of the contributions by Wind to these scientific topics that emphasize its importance to both the fields of heliophysics and astrophysics.},
